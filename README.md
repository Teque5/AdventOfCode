# AdventOfCode

This is repository holds my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## 2023

Going with rust again, hope I can make it all the way! This year I am dynamically getting the input from the AoC servers, so we'll need to `export AOC_SESSION=D34DBEEF` before using. Google how to retrieve `AOC_SESSION`.

## 2022

Using this as an opportunity to learn [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I did use python on some of the puzzles where I was racing against colleagues. :D
